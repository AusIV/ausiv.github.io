<center><a href="/">Austin Roberts</a> is a freelance software developer. <br/>[<a href="/assets/resume.pdf">CV</a>]</center>

## Technology

I've always had a passion for technology and the ways it can improve people's lives. In my professional career, I have been:

* Server-side web developer
* Front-end web developer
* Development Team Lead
* DevOps lead
* Software Architect

And I've worked extensively with the following software:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* JavaScript
* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)
* [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
* [SaltStack](https://saltstack.com/)
* [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)
* [Gatling](http://gatling.io/)

And I've had some experience with numerous other technologies.

While my background is primarily in software I also tinker with electronics,
ranging from mobile devices to the Raspberry Pi.

## Education

Personally, I have a Master's Degree in Computer Science. Education was a huge
factor in shaping who I am personally and professionally.

More broadly, I think education is one of the most important things for society
to focus on. Many of the problems facing the world today will only be solved by
well educated people, and I think bringing the best possible education to the
widest possible audience is one of the best ways to accelerate the advancement
of our society.

Until very recently, I worked for Computerized Assessments and Learning, hoping
to combine two of my passions and use technology to help further education. As
CA&L was dissolved and absorbed into its parent company, I decided to go
freelance to pursue these passions independently.

## Family

I am the father of two young boys, and they are a huge part of my world. Part
of my passion for education stems from wanting to make sure my own children get
a good education, and grow up in a world where education is given a high
priority.

I also work hard to expose my boys to a wide range of technology. They've both
used computers from a very early age, and a while back we even set out to build
a Raspberry Pi driven robot!

## Food

Another major passion of mine is food. Aside from liking to eat good food, I
like to learn how to make a wide variety of food. I've been making [my own pizza](http://scratch.ausiv.com/recipe/pizza/2015/06/26/austins-signature-pizza.html)
for years, and have recently started dabbling in cheese making, including my
first successful traditional cheddar.
