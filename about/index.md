<center><a href="/">Austin Roberts</a> is an entrepreneur and technology consultant
based out of Kansas City. <br/>[<a href="/assets/resume.pdf">CV</a>]</center>

## Business

Austin is an entrepreneur, having founded [Note G](https://noteg.io) - a small
consulting company, and [OpenRelay](https://openrelay.xyz) - a company building
technology to facilitate decentralized trading of digitalized assets.

## Technology

I've always had a passion for technology and the ways it can improve people's lives. In my professional career, I have been:

* Server-side web developer
* Front-end web developer
* Development Team Lead
* DevOps lead
* Software Architect
* Blockchain Developer

And I've worked extensively with the following software:

* [Golang](https://golang.org/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* JavaScript
* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)
* [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
* [SaltStack](https://saltstack.com/)
* [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)
* [Gatling](http://gatling.io/)
* [0x Protocol](https://0xproject.com/)
* [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/)

And I've had some experience with numerous other technologies.

While my background is primarily in software I also tinker with electronics,
ranging from mobile devices to the Raspberry Pi.

## Education

Personally, I have a Master's Degree in Computer Science. Education was a huge
factor in shaping who I am personally and professionally.

More broadly, I think education is one of the most important things for society
to focus on. Many of the problems facing the world today will only be solved by
well educated people, and I think bringing the best possible education to the
widest possible audience is one of the best ways to accelerate the advancement
of our society.

For a couple of years I worked for Computerized Assessments and Learning,
hoping to combine two of my passions and use technology to help further
education. As CA&L was dissolved and absorbed into its parent company, I
decided to start consulting  to pursue these passions independently.

## Family

I am the father of two young boys, and they are a huge part of my world. Part
of my passion for education stems from wanting to make sure my own children get
a good education, and grow up in a world where education is given a high
priority.

I also work hard to expose my boys to a wide range of technology. They've both
used computers from a very early age, and a while back we even set out to build
a Raspberry Pi driven robot!

## Food

Another major passion of mine is food. Aside from liking to eat good food, I
like to learn how to make a wide variety of food. I've been making [my own pizza](http://scratch.ausiv.com/recipe/pizza/2015/06/26/austins-signature-pizza.html)
for years, and have recently started dabbling in cheese making, including my
first successful traditional cheddar.
